0. To generate rollout data from expert policy run: (Reacher-v1 example)
    - generates 20,000 examples and saves them in the directory rollout_data
    
    mkdir rollout_data
    python run_experts.py experts/Reacher-v1.pkl Reacher-v1 --num_rollouts 20

3.1. To train a behavioral cloning agent run:
    - to work with a different env change line 7 (import bc_models.walker2d as bc_agent)
    - models available are in ./bc_models/
    
    mkdir tf
    python behavioral_cloning.py train

3.2 To train different models with different dropout parameters:
    - uncomment line 141 in behavioral_cloning.py (#dropouts = [1.0, .975, .95, .925, .9, .875, .85, .825, .8, .775, .75, .725, .7])
  
    python behavioral_cloning.py train

    To compare different models in the gym env run:
    - This will look in dirs ./tf/Reacher-v1_1.0* and run each found model in the gym environment for 20 rollouts, finally plotting the mean and std dev of return for each dropout param
    python test_reacher_dropout.py

4.2 To generate the plot for dagger run:
    - check line 7 in behavioral_cloning.py it should be: (import bc_models.reacher as bc_agent)

    mkdir dagger
    python dagger.py
